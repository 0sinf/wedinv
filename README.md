# 결혼을 아무쪼록 축하드립니다.

내 맘대로 아무것도 할 수 없는 결혼이지만, 모바일 청첩장만이라도 편안하시길 바랍니다.

## Getting Started

First, you need to create a Google Spreadsheet for this project. Please check [this page](https://www.labnol.org/google-api-service-account-220404) for setting up a service account.
Once you add your service account as the editor of the spreadsheet, then please update such details in '.env' file.

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
# if you don't have next.js project in your local machine
$ npm i next


$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
